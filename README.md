Dataset
The dataset used in this project is sourced from [source, if specified], containing measurements of pollutants like PM2.5, PM10, NO2, SO2, CO, O3, and environmental factors such as temperature and humidity.

You can find the dataset details in the data/ folder or as specified in the project.

Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
git clone https://github.com/AS-AyushSingh/Air_quality_prediction.git
Navigate into the project directory:

bash
cd Air_quality_prediction
Install the required dependencies:

bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
(Ensure you have a requirements.txt file with all the necessary Python packages.)

Usage
Prepare your dataset and update the file paths if necessary. To run the main prediction script:

bash
python predict.py
Follow the prompts or configure parameters within the script as needed.

Modeling
The project employs various machine learning algorithms such as Linear Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Regression, etc., to model and predict air quality indices.

Details of the models, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation metrics are included in the notebooks/ or models/ directories.

Results
Results are displayed through accuracy scores, RMSE, R2 scores, and visualizations. These help in understanding the performance of each model.
